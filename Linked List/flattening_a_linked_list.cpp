/*
Given a Linked List of size N, where every node represents a linked list and contains two pointers of its type:
(i) a next pointer to the next node,
(ii) a bottom pointer to a linked list where this node is head.

You have to flatten the linked list to a single linked list which should be sorted.
       5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28
       |    |     |     |
       V    V     V     V
       7    20    22    35
       |          |     |
       V          V     V
       8          50    40
       |                |
       V                V
       30               45
       
And after flattening the above list, the sorted linked list looks like:

 5-> 7-> 8- > 10 -> 19-> 20-> 22-> 28-> 30-> 35-> 40-> 45-> 50.

Note: The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of next pointer.
